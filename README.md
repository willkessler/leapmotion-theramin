## A Theramin Controlled by Leap Motion


A Theramin was a 1960's era instrument you played by just waving your hands in the air. One hand controlled pitch, the other, volume, with some variability in gesturing.

I figured a LeapMotion could be much more expressive, so I started to experiment with a simple js-based Theramin using Leap. 

It leverages the `leapjs` library, and runs on a computer that supports Leap's SDK (unfortunately, not Rasbian). 

It also leverages the Pizzicato library for sound effects.

To use it just open `index.html`.
